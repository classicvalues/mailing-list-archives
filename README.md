# Modern Mailing List Archives

This repository is used to experiment with various approaches to
modernizing W3C's mailing list archives.

Goals include:

  - improve readability of default styles (incl. proportional fonts)
  - improve usability on mobile devices
  - provide a thread view that spans hypermail's period boundaries
  - provide a flattened view of message threads (all messages on one page)
  - preserve the stable URIs for messages in W3C's existing archives
